# Presentation boilerplates and templates

Presentation boilerplates and templates that I use. All presentation boilerplates and templates are free to use by anyone for anything. Attribution is not required; derivatives are ok; it is not necessary to "share-alike"; commercial use is fine.

## Simple presentation

My simple presentation template. Black, white and gray, with teal(?) links and no silly images.

The majority of [my presentations on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/jeffreybarke) use the PowerPoint template.

* `Simple presentation.key`: Keynote boilerplate.
* `Simple presentation.otp`: OpenDocument presentation template. I use it with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/).
* `Simple presentation.potx`: Microsoft PowerPoint presentation template.
